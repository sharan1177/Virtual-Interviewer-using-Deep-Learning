One of the important stages in the life of a student is his or her first job. Naturally, a candidate will be quite nervous during an interview as it is a completely new experience. Due to such nervousness, a candidate might not be able to project his/her emotions correctly. This can have a negative impact on the result of the interview. To avoid this, prior practice is required. In order to make the candidate become more confident, we propose a system in which a candidate can practice some commonly asked interview questions and receive concrete feedback based on the response submitted. This will help a candidate become a best fit for the company. The system will put some common interview questions to the user. The system will use deep learning models to detect the emotions in the input. The analysis of each question will be shown to the user. This report contains the most common emotion displayed by the user throughout the interview. This comparison will help the user his/her shortcomings and thus, help him/her prepare better for the interview process.
